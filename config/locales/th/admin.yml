        description_1: Traditionally, computer programs are designed by establishing precise rules about what the program should do in each situation, and how to process the available information at each moment. What is commonly known as AI/Machine Learning is a type of programs for which what is precisely established is what the task to be performed is and how it is assessed whether the task is better or worse performed. But unlike the former, the system discovers or learns what would be the most suitable method to perform the task.
        description_2: This module allows any type of AI/Machine Learning programs to be implemented in CONSUL. The programs can process the information available in CONSUL and produce results that help both users and administrators to carry out more effective and intelligent citizen participation. The module has been developed to make it easy to implement and run new programs, keeping the general code of CONSUL and the code of these new programs independent from each other.
        description_3: To use it for the first time it is necessary to follow the instructions available in the CONSUL documentation to properly activate this module. Once the module is correctly activated, the programs are executed from the "Execute scripts" tab. Before executing it, we can see in the same tab an estimation of the execution time and other relevant information. At the end of the execution, we can activate the content that will be shown in CONSUL from the "Settings" tab, as well as download other generated files that may be useful to us.
        description_4: Please use previous scripts as examples.
        description_4b: The new scripts should be located in the folder <code>public/machine_learning/scripts</code>
        description_4c: The input data to be used by the script will be created as JSON files in the folder <code>../data</code>
        description_4d: Any generated output should be placed in the folder <code>../data</code>
        description_4e: It is recommended to create an independent <code>.ini</code> text file with the settings of the script, with the same name of the script and readable by configparser. This file will facilitate settings change by the administrators.
        description_4f: It is recommended to include as the first line of the script an initial triple-quote string with some brief information about it and links to any relevant information. This string will be automatically shown in the Administration interface.
        description_4g: It is recommended to log the relevant information of the script in a <code>.log</code> text file, with the same name of the script.
